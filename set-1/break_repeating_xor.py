########## 1-1: convert hex to base64 ##########

# https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/1
# Always operate on raw bytes, never on encoded strings. Only use hex and base64 for pretty-printing.

# what does this mean?
# b'foo' instead of a regular s='foo'
#   we want to use the bytes or bytearray type in python, not the string type.
# indexing a str: returns char
# indexing a b'': returns int

# bytes() are immutable (b'')
# bytearray() are not.

# why does bytes require an encoding?
# no, each of these should correspond to a particular byte in the file.....
# i guess, if it's unicode, hm..... how would you interpret the four bytes or so?
# you'd need to specify the encoding.

# For each KEYSIZE, take the first KEYSIZE worth of bytes, 
# and the second KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and find the edit 
# distance between them. Normalize this result by dividing by KEYSIZE.

#	take two blocks (at your given keysize)
#	compute edit distance and divide by KEYSIZE to normalize
#	the smallest one is your key, probably. grab the first three just in case.

# The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably
# the key. You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE
# values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE blocks instead of 2 and average the distances.

# Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into blocks of KEYSIZE length.
# Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of every block, and a block that is the second byte of every block, and so on.
# Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already have code to do this.
# For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best looking histogram is the repeating-key XOR key byte for that block. Put them together and you have the key.


# broadly, there's two steps: find the KEYSIZE, then find the .... alignment, most likely, since it's probably a repeating key.
# the approach for finding the alignment is interesting. naively i would probably iterate through each byte and decrypt a chunk, then
# manually check to see if that chunk is readable.

# but the approach they layout is slightly different. knowing the keysize, we first transpose the blocks so we get a bunch of containers 
# that hold the i'th byte or whatever. each of these has been xor'd with a single byte.

# oh! but it occurs to me that we don't know the key at all. getting the keysize alone is only part of the problem. we then need to recover the
# actual key, which is easiest to do with a single-key xor.
