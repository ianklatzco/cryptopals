# convert hex to base64

# TODO setup mypy

# https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/1
# from docs: 
# Always operate on raw bytes, never on encoded strings. Only use hex and base64 for pretty-printing.

# what does this mean?

# guessing b'' instead of a regular s=''

# bytes() are immutable (b'')
# bytearray() are not.

# why does bytes require an encoding? oh i guess that's kind the definition of an encoding? 
# no, each of these should correspond to a particular byte in the file.....
# i guess, if it's unicode, hm..... how would you interpret the four bytes or so?
# you'd need to specify the encoding.

# each of these chars maps to a 6 bit value, starting at 000000 and up till 111111, incrementing as standard binary does.
# chunk 6 bits and do a table lookup.

# build the table
# list of tuples

# for c in ascii_rep:
# 	t.append( (c,bin_rep) )
# 	bin_rep = bin_rep + 1

# this data structure may not have made the most sense. 
# we need to lookup by 6-bit value.
